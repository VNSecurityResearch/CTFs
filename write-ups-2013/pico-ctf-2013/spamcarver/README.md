# PicoCTF 2013: Spamcarver

**Category:** Forensic
**Points:** 70
**Description:**

> While exploring an alien tomb, you find an ancient jpg of [an ancient can of SPAM](https://2013.picoctf.com/problems/spamcarver.jpg). It seems valueless, but the guardbots really want it back, so perhaps there's something more here than meets the eye. Maybe it's cursed, or hexed, if you will?
