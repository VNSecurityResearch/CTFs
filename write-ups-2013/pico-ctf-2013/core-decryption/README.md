# PicoCTF 2013: Core Decryption

**Category:** Forensic
**Points:** 120
**Description:**

> In a ruined city on a forgotten world, you find a broken cogitator controlling access to the Vault. You have blueprints for the machine, and a stickynote attached to the monitor with the encrypted input. The machine seems to have crashed while decrypting, and generated a core dump, too. Maybe if you can get the encryption keys out of the core dump, you can decrypt the ciphertext and get the vault open...
